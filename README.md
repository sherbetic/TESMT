# Q: WHAT IS TESMT?

<b>A:</b> Tesmt is a community based hangout game on the ROBLOX platform made to make bonds or relations - friends or groups inside the game! 
The game itself is based off of STUD-BASED design, a type of roblox style usually refered to as "retro" or "classic."

Inside of the game, you are given the option to hang around with new or fond friends yet to be made exploring the vast world of bright colors and lights.
There are NPC's seen roaming or stationary at most - players are able to talk to these NPC's if done willingly, and a quest can be made!
###### It's too much to be explained so vaguely.. so, why not hit the game up? Play on your own time, friend! :3
